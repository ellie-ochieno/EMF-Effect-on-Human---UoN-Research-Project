# EMF-Effect-on-Human---UoN-Research-Project

Available at: https://www.emf-health.uon-powernet.com/

The project is based on Effect of Electromagnetic radiation in the sorrounding on human health.
A research done by the University of Nairobi Dept. of EIE 2020-2022. It involves determining the intensity of EMF radiation
as emitted by various communication systems installed in various areas withibn the public environs. This is detected by special
EMF-detector meters which calibrates the radiation intensities in units of Specific Absorption Rate(SAR). The data recorded is 
analysed and compared to the required World Health Organization(WHO) standards.

The repository contains the above described project web platform that embeds the information captured in 
the project development.
